.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[C]client\f[] [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[]] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]client\f[] is a dæmon that connects to a \f[C]tracker\f[](1) and
other instances of itself across several machines or networks to send or
download files.
.PP
The \f[C]tracker\f[] is required to share a list of SHA256 hashes and
register hosts.
Once those basic data are exchanged, each \f[C]client\f[] can connect to
each other and start copying files over the network.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[C]\-\-put\ filename\f[]
Instructs the client to share the file pointed to by \f[C]filename\f[]
to other hosts.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-\-get\ hash\ filename\f[]
Instructs the client to download the file whose hash is requested to a
file named \f[C]filename\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-l\ port\f[]
Instructs the client to listen on a specific port number instead of the
default value of \f[C]9001\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-h\ address\f[]
Connect to the tracker at a given address.

.B \f[C]\-p\ port\f[]

.SH RETURN VALUES
.PP
\f[C]client\f[] is designed to work as a dæmon and will not return on
its own.
.PP
To run it into background, refer to the documentation of your operating
system's bootscripts.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Both \f[C]client\f[] and \f[C]tracker\f[] have not been stress\-tested
and may not be suitable for resource\-constrained environments.
.PP
Both \f[C]client\f[] and \f[C]tracker\f[] have not been reviewed for
security concerns either \[em] due to time constraints \[em] and are
very likely vulnerable to various kinds of attacks.
\f[I]DO NOT USE\f[] these applications to transfer data between hosts
that are exposed to the public.
.PP
The safety of the transmitted data, however, is only as strong as
SHA256.
.PP
The \f[C]client\f[] has no control UI.
Several approaches could be taken, the preferred one being to use a
local fifo(7) to send data from an interactive UI.
